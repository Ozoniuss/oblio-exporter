In Romania, every limited responsibility company must download all issued invoices to customers and store them for up to 5 years, due to proper government spending in digitalization. That means my mom, who essentially learned to use the computer in the last 10 years because it was a must for owning a company, is faced with needing a resilient storage solution where she can back up all those invoices, because the issuer's platform only keeps them for two months.

Now, imagine what would mean downloading every single bill, and storing it on her 6 year-old cheap laptop alongisde hundreds of others. And expecting them to be there 5 years from now. This solution downloads all issued bills from the platform my mom uses, and uploads them to Backblaze.
